THE BASICS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The basic steps to viewing a model are as follows:

 * (Optional) Enter the desired directory in the text-box at the top-left
 * Press the button labelled "Scan Dir." (beside the text-box)
 * Presuming that model-files were found, look through the resultant list in the scroll-frame below the text-box
 * Presuming that the desired model is present, click on its button
 * Press one of the shader-buttons at the top-right to apply a shader


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CONTROLS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * To rotate the model, hold the left mouse-button and drag the mouse.

 * To scale the model, hold the right mouse-button and drag the mouse up or down.

 * To fit the model to the viewing-area, press the button at the bottom-right.

 * To toggle automated turntable-rotation of the model, check or uncheck the checkbox at the bottom-left.

NOTES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The directory to be scanned is set relative to the working directory of the program, I believe.

The directory-scan is recursive, and thus should gather model-files from not only the indicated directory, but all below it, too.

The default directory is "../Assets/"--i.e. the base asset folder.

When the program is started, no shader is active--a shader is only applied by the pressing of one of the shader-buttons at the top-right of the view.

It should be safe to repeat the scanning process, whether with the same directory or another.

It should be safe to load multiple models one after another.

You should be able to swap back and forth between shaders at will.
